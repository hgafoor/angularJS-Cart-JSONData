# angularJS-Cart-JSONData

AngularJS Shopping Cart was forked from  [Bernado Castilho's sample
on Code Project](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/576246/A-Shopping-Cart-Application-Built-with-AngularJS) to add
json data support to it.

Changes
-------
* changed the project back to HTML + JS + CSS + JSON + IMG files 
* changed angular code sections to include json files as the source of data.
** working on changing the project to use angularJS alone for JS tasks, removing parts using jQuery.
